💫 A Little About Me

I’m a software engineer who loves bringing creative ideas to life through code. From telecom solutions that keep the world connected to fintech platforms that simplify payments — I’ve built and contributed to tech that actually makes a difference.

When I’m not deep in Dart or debugging Java, I’m probably exploring open-source projects or refining an idea that could become someone’s next favourite app.
